# Frontend Mentor - Interactive comments section solution

This is a solution to the [Interactive comments section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-comments-section-iG1RugEG9). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

I am completing this challenge as part of the [Introduction to front-end testing](https://www.frontendmentor.io/learning-paths/introduction-to-front-end-testing-kacF_IJQO5) Frontend Mentor learning path. This continues my efforts to learn my chosen JS Framework - [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) + [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/). And now my more specific goal for this challenge was to learn to incorporate [integration tests](https://www.frontendmentor.io/learning-paths/introduction-to-front-end-testing-kacF_IJQO5/steps/689e5149d98fffca3e5870a4/article/read).

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

### Expected behaviour

- First-level comments should be ordered by their score, whereas nested replies are ordered by time added.
- Replying to a comment adds the new reply to the bottom of the nested replies within that comment.
- A confirmation modal should pop up before a comment or reply is deleted.
- Adding a new comment or reply uses the `currentUser` object from within the `data.json` file.
- You can only edit or delete your own comments and replies.

### Continued development

Specific areas that the solution should be improved (known issues):

- [x] Don't immediately give focus to the default add new comment textarea (unlike the conditional reply textareas, which should automatically get focus)
  - Solved this using Vue's [Custom Directives](https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/custom-directives). Very cool. :sunglasses:
- [ ] Add in error checking/validation.
  - For example, should the store enforce that a new comment can be added only if there is a current
  - And should an update or deletion only be made if the current user matches the author of the comment to be updated or deleted?
- [ ] Make sure form and input element ids are each unique (especially if reusing components in different places, under different conditions). For example, do the new comment creation form and textarea inputs have unique ids compared to ones that are created for replying to a post?
- [ ] In comment user component, if only showing the image (`format='image-only'`), include the username as 'sr-only' rather than excluding it entirely.
- [ ] Consider using container queries to make layout adjustments rather than media queries
- [ ] Think more about whether there should be a limit to how nested the replies can be. Or at least how nested the formatting can get, especially in narrower viewport widths.
- [ ] Think about combining the editing of an existing comment with the new comment into a common component (or components)

Specific enhancements I'd like to make (feature requests):

- [ ] ...

More general ideas I want to consider:

Hmm ðŸ¤” ...

- Learn and use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Implement a full-stack app
